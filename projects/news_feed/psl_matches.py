    Script for extracting data of PSL 2019 matches
    :file: psl_matches.py
    :platform: Windows 10
    :synopsis:
        This script first uses request function to open the
        intended psl website and saves the links of all psl
        matches in a list. After this, it grabs all the
        information (including teams, their scores and result)
        from the website and store it in their relevant lists.
        At last, this script displays all the information in
        tabular form using pandas data frame.
